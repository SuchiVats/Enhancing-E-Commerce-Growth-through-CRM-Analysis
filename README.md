# CRM Analysis for E-Commerce: Customer-Centric Insights

## Project Overview
The aim of this project is to conduct an in-depth **Customer Relationship Management (CRM) analysis** on an e-commerce dataset. By applying data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and customer segmentation techniques, we aim to derive actionable insights to improve customer retention, marketing strategies, and overall business performance.

Through this case study, we will:
- **Understand customer behavior** using Recency, Frequency, and Monetary (RFM) analysis.
- **Segment customers** based on their shopping habits to tailor marketing efforts.
- **Provide recommendations** to optimize customer engagement and increase sales.

## Problem Statement
The e-commerce industry faces challenges in understanding customer behavior, which impacts customer retention, acquisition, and overall revenue. This project aims to answer the following questions:
- How frequently do customers purchase from the platform?
- What time of the day and month do customers tend to shop the most?
- Which customers are at risk of churning, and which are the most loyal?

By answering these questions, we will be able to provide actionable recommendations for improving customer engagement and increasing profitability.

## Approach and Workflow

### 1. **Data Preprocessing**
The first step is to clean the dataset and prepare it for analysis by performing the following actions:
- **Missing Values:** Handled missing data by either filling it with relevant values or dropping incomplete records.
- **Duplicates:** Removed duplicate entries that may distort customer behavior analysis.
- **Data Types:** Converted date and transaction-related columns into appropriate data types for easier processing.

### 2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
In this step, we explored the data to uncover key patterns in customer transactions and purchasing behavior:
- **Popular Shopping Hours:** Identified peak hours for transactions, with most purchases occurring between 12 PM and 3 PM.
- **Number of Orders by Month and Day:** Analyzed purchasing trends across months and days to understand seasonal spikes.
- **Average Days Between Purchases:** Measured how frequently customers return to the platform to make a purchase.

### 3. **Feature Engineering & RFM Analysis**
For deeper insights, we engineered customer-centric features to segment the customer base:
- **Recency, Frequency, and Monetary (RFM) Analysis:**
  - **Recency:** How recently did the customer make a purchase?
  - **Frequency:** How often does the customer make purchases?
  - **Monetary:** How much does the customer spend?

- **Customer Segmentation:**
  - Segmented customers into categories like **High-Value Customers**, **At-Risk Customers**, and **Loyal Customers** based on their RFM scores.

### 4. **Insights Derived**
From the analysis, the following key insights were drawn:
- **Shopping Hours:** Most customers shop between **12 PM and 3 PM**, suggesting this is an optimal time for promotions.
- **Seasonality:** **November** sees the highest volume of orders, likely due to holiday shopping, while **February** and **April** experience significant drop-offs.
- **Frequent Shoppers:** Customers tend to make repeat purchases within a span of **0-10 days**, indicating high engagement.

## Recommendations

### 1. **Targeted Promotions:**
   - Run special promotions during the peak shopping hours of **12 PM - 3 PM** to capture the majority of the customers.
   - Offer **early-bird deals** starting in **October** to capture pre-holiday shoppers and extend the sales peak beyond November.

### 2. **Customer Retention:**
   - Implement a **loyalty program** for customers who shop frequently (within 0-10 days) to incentivize repeat purchases.
   - Send targeted re-engagement campaigns to customers identified as **at-risk** of churning, based on their low recency scores.

### 3. **Personalized Offers:**
   - Use **RFM segmentation** to deliver personalized offers to high-value customers, aiming to increase their lifetime value.
   - Introduce **seasonal promotions** in slow months like February to maintain steady sales flow.

## Conclusion
Through this CRM analysis, we have identified key customer behaviors, segmented customers based on their RFM scores, and provided data-driven recommendations to enhance customer retention and increase sales. By understanding customer preferences and habits, businesses can make more informed decisions about marketing strategies and customer engagement efforts.
